  "question": "Investment of $10000 grows 8% annually. How long until it doubles? Show the math.",
  "answer": "Okay, let\u2019s tackle this investment problem step-by-step.\n\n**1. Approach:**\n\nWe\u2019ll use the compound interest formula to calculate the time it takes for an investment to double. The formula is:\n\n*   **Future Value (FV) = Principal (P) * (1 + Rate (R))^(Number of Years (N))**\n\nIn our case:\n\n*   Principal (P) = $10000\n*   Rate (R) = 8% = 0.08\n*   Number of Years (N) = ? (We need to find this)\n\n**2. Show each step of the solution:**\n\nLet\u2019s plug the values into the formula:\n\nFV = 10000 * (1 + 0.08)^(Number of Years)\n\nWe want to find the number of years it takes for the investment to double, so we\u2019ll set FV = 2 * Principal:\n\n2 * 10000 = 10000 * (1 + 0.08)^(Number of Years)\n\n20000 = 10000 * (1.08)^(Number of Years)\n\nDivide both sides by 10000:\n\n2 = (1.08)^(Number of Years)\n\nNow, we need to solve for the Number of Years.  We can do this by taking the logarithm of both sides:\n\nlog(2) = log((1.08)^(Number of Years))\n\nlog(2) \u2248 0.3010\n\nNow, exponentiate both sides:\n\n2^log(2) = (1.08)^(Number of Years)\n\n2^0.3010 = (1.08)^(Number of Years)\n\n2.  3010 \u2248 (1.08)^(Number of Years)\n\nNow, we can solve for Number of Years by taking the power of both sides:\n\n2.  3010^1 = (1.08)^(Number of Years)\n\n4.  3010 = (1.08)^(Number of Years)\n\nNow, we can use logarithms again to solve for Number of Years:\n\nlog(4.3010) = Number of Years\n\nNumber of Years \u2248 4.3010 / 0.3010 \u2248 14.28\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a year, we round up to 15 years.\n\n**3. Verify the Answer:**\n\nLet's check if 15 years is a reasonable time to double the investment:\n\n*   After 10 years:  FV = 10000 * (1.08)^10 \u2248 10000 * 2.1589 \u2248 21589\n*   After 15 years:  FV = 10000 * (1.08)^15 \u2248 10000 * 2.3673 \u2248 23673\n\nSince 15 years is closer to doubling than 10 years, we can confidently say that it will take approximately 15 years for the investment to double.\n\n**Final Answer:** It will take approximately **15 years** for the investment to double.",
