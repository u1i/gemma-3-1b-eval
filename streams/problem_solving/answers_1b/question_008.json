  "question": "A ball is thrown upward at 20 m/s. When will it reach 15m height? Show calculations.",
  "answer": "Okay, let\u2019s solve this problem step-by-step.\n\n**1. Approach:**\n\nWe\u2019ll use the following concepts:\n\n*   **Vertical Motion:** We\u2019ll analyze the ball\u2019s vertical motion to determine its height as a function of time.\n*   **Constant Acceleration:** We\u2019ll assume the only force acting on the ball is gravity, which causes a constant downward acceleration.\n*   **Relevant Equation:** We\u2019ll use the following kinematic equation:  `h = h\u2080 + v\u2080t - 0.5at\u00b2` where:\n    *   `h` = final height\n    *   `h\u2080` = initial height (0 m in this case, since the ball is thrown upwards)\n    *   `v\u2080` = initial velocity (20 m/s)\n    *   `t` = time (what we want to find)\n    *   `a` = acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s\u00b2)\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Define the variables and initial conditions.**\n\n    *   Let `h` be the final height (15 m).\n    *   Let `v\u2080` be 20 m/s.\n    *   Let `g` be the acceleration due to gravity, which is approximately 9.8 m/s\u00b2.\n\n*   **Step 2:  Write the equation.**\n\n    We want to find the time `t` when `h = 15`.  Using the equation:\n\n    `h = h\u2080 + v\u2080t - 0.5at\u00b2`\n\n    Substituting the known values:\n\n    `15 = 0 + 20t - 0.5 * 9.8t\u00b2`\n\n*   **Step 3: Simplify and solve for t.**\n\n    `15 = 20t - 4.9t\u00b2`\n\n    Rearrange into a quadratic equation:\n\n    `4.9t\u00b2 - 20t + 15 = 0`\n\n    Now, use the quadratic formula to solve for `t`:\n\n    `t = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / 2a`\n\n    Where:\n    *   `a = 4.9`\n    *   `b = -20`\n    *   `c = 15`\n\n    `t = (-(-20) \u00b1 \u221a((-20)\u00b2 - 4 * 4.9 * 15)) / (2 * 4.9)`\n\n    `t = (20 \u00b1 \u221a(400 - 294)) / 9.8`\n\n    `t = (20 \u00b1 \u221a(106)) / 9.8`\n\n    `t = (20 \u00b1 10.3) / 9.8`\n\n    This gives us two possible solutions:\n\n    *   `t\u2081 = (20 + 10.3) / 9.8 = 30.3 / 9.8 \u2248 3.04 seconds`\n    *   `t\u2082 = (20 - 10.3) / 9.8 = 9.7 / 9.8 \u2248 0.98 seconds`\n\n*   **Step 4: Choose the appropriate time.**\n\n    Since time cannot be negative, we choose the positive value:  `t \u2248 3.04 seconds`\n\n**3. Verification:**\n\nLet's check our answer:\n\n*   At `t = 3.04` seconds:\n    *   `h = 0 + 20 * 3.04 - 0.5 * 9.8 * (3.04)\u00b2`\n    *   `h = 60.8 - 4.9 * 9.2464`\n    *   `h = 60.8 - 45.36`\n    *   `h = 15.44 meters`\n\nThis is very close to 15 meters, so our answer is reasonable.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nIt will take approximately **3.04 seconds** for the ball to reach a height of 15 meters.\n\n---\n\nDo you want me to:\n\n*   Explain any of these steps in more detail?\n*   Work with a different problem?",
