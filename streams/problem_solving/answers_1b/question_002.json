  "question": "Eight people need to cross a bridge at night with one flashlight. The bridge holds max two people. Times to cross: (1",
  "answer": "Okay, let\u2019s solve this problem step-by-step.\n\n**1. Approach:**\n\nThe core of this problem is to find a strategy that allows us to successfully cross the bridge with only two people. We need to think about how to maximize the number of people who can cross simultaneously. The key is to strategically position the flashlight to ensure that the first person crosses, and then the second person crosses *after* the first person.  This minimizes the number of people needing to be present at the bridge\u2019s edge.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\nLet's represent the people as P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, and P8.\n\n* **Step 1: Initial Setup.**  We have eight people.  The bridge can only hold two people at a time.\n\n* **Step 2: First Crossing.**  The first person (P1) crosses the bridge. Now there are seven people remaining.\n\n* **Step 3: Second Crossing.** The second person (P2) crosses the bridge. Now there are six people remaining.\n\n* **Step 4: Third Crossing.** The first person (P1) crosses the bridge. Now there are five people remaining.\n\n* **Step 5: Fourth Crossing.** The second person (P2) crosses the bridge. Now there are four people remaining.\n\n* **Step 6: Fifth Crossing.** The first person (P1) crosses the bridge. Now there are three people remaining.\n\n* **Step 7: Sixth Crossing.** The second person (P2) crosses the bridge. Now there are two people remaining.\n\n* **Step 8: Seventh Crossing.** The first person (P1) crosses the bridge. Now there is one person remaining.\n\n* **Step 9: Eighth Crossing.** The second person (P2) crosses the bridge.  Now there are no people remaining.\n\n**3. Verification:**\n\nLet's check if this solution works:\n\n*   Initially: 8 people\n*   P1 crosses: 1 person\n*   P2 crosses: 1 person\n*   P1 crosses: 2 people\n*   P2 crosses: 2 people\n*   P1 crosses: 3 people\n*   P2 crosses: 3 people\n*   P1 crosses: 4 people\n*   P2 crosses: 4 people\n*   P1 crosses: 5 people\n*   P2 crosses: 5 people\n*   P1 crosses: 6 people\n*   P2 crosses: 6 people\n*   P1 crosses: 7 people\n*   P2 crosses: 7 people\n*   P1 crosses: 8 people\n\nWe have successfully crossed the bridge with two people at a time.  The solution is correct.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nIt is possible to cross the bridge with two people at a time.",
