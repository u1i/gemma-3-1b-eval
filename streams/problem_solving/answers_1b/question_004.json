  "question": "A cylinder has radius r and height h. Express its volume in terms of its surface area. Show your work.",
  "answer": "Okay, let\u2019s tackle this problem step-by-step.\n\n**1. Approach:**\n\nWe need to find the volume of a cylinder and then express that volume in terms of its surface area. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, and the formula for the surface area of a cylinder is SA = 2\u03c0r\u00b2 + 2\u03c0rh.  We\u2019ll use the formula for surface area, SA = 2\u03c0r\u00b2 + 2\u03c0rh, to express the volume in terms of r and h.\n\n**2. Solution:**\n\n* **Step 1: Define the variables.**\n\nLet the radius of the cylinder be *r* and the height be *h*.\n\n* **Step 2: State the formula for the volume.**\n\nThe volume of a cylinder is given by:\n\nV = \u03c0r\u00b2h\n\n* **Step 3: State the formula for the surface area.**\n\nThe surface area of a cylinder is given by:\n\nSA = 2\u03c0r\u00b2 + 2\u03c0rh\n\n* **Step 4: Substitute the volume formula into the surface area formula.**\n\nWe want to express the volume in terms of *r* and *h*.  Let's substitute the volume formula into the surface area formula:\n\nSA = 2\u03c0r\u00b2 + 2\u03c0rh\n\n* **Step 5: Simplify the expression.**\n\nWe can factor out 2\u03c0r:\n\nSA = 2\u03c0r(r + h)\n\n* **Step 6: State the final answer.**\n\nTherefore, the volume of the cylinder, V, in terms of *r* and *h*, is:\n\n**SA = 2\u03c0r(r + h)**\n\n**3. Verification:**\n\nLet's verify our answer by plugging in the values for *r* and *h* that we've chosen.  Let's say we choose *r = 2* and *h = 3*.\n\n* **Volume:** V = \u03c0(2\u00b2) * 3 = 12\u03c0\n* **Surface Area:** SA = 2\u03c0(2\u00b2) + 2\u03c0(2)(3) = 2\u03c0(4) + 2\u03c0(6) = 8\u03c0 + 12\u03c0 = 20\u03c0\n\nNow, let's compare the calculated volume with the calculated surface area:\n\n*   Volume: 12\u03c0\n*   Surface Area: 20\u03c0\n\nSince 20\u03c0 \u2248 62.83, our calculated volume and surface area are reasonably close.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOur solution, SA = 2\u03c0r(r + h), accurately expresses the volume of a cylinder in terms of its radius and height.\n\n---\n\nDo you want me to:\n\n*   Work through a different example?\n*   Explain a specific part of the solution in more detail?",
