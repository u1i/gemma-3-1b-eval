  "answer": "Okay, let\u2019s design an algorithm to find the longest palindrome in a string. Here\u2019s a step-by-step explanation, incorporating a common and efficient approach:\n\n**1. Approach Outline**\n\nThe core idea is to check if a string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backward. We\u2019ll use a two-pointer approach \u2013 one pointer moves from both ends of the string, and the other pointer moves from the center.  We\u2019ll maintain a variable to keep track of the longest palindrome found so far.  We\u2019ll also consider the case where a single character is the longest palindrome.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\nLet\u2019s say we have the string `s = \"bananas\"`.  Here\u2019s how the algorithm would proceed:\n\n* **Step 1: Initialization**\n    * `longest_palindrome = 0`  (Initialize the longest palindrome found so far to 0)\n    * `center_index = 0` (Initialize the center index of the longest palindrome to 0)\n\n* **Step 2: Iterate through the string (from left to right)**\n    * `for i from 0 to len(s) - 1:`:  This loop iterates through each character of the string `s`.\n    * `if s[i] == s[len(s) - 1 - i]:` :  This is the core palindrome check.  It compares the character at the current index `i` with the character at the corresponding index from the end of the string (`len(s) - 1 - i`).\n        * If they are equal, it means we have found a palindrome.\n    * **If the palindrome is found:**\n        * `longest_palindrome = max(longest_palindrome, i)`:  Update `longest_palindrome` to the larger value between its current value and the current index `i`.  This ensures we always keep track of the *longest* palindrome found so far.\n    * **If the palindrome is not found:**\n        * `center_index = i`:  If the current character doesn't match the character from the end, we move the `center_index` to the current index `i`. This effectively marks the start of the palindrome.\n\n* **Step 3: After the loop completes:**\n    * `if longest_palindrome > 0:`:  If `longest_palindrome` is still greater than 0, it means we've found a palindrome.\n    * `return longest_palindrome`: Return the value of `longest_palindrome`.\n\n* **Step 4:  Handle the case of a single-character palindrome:**\n    * `if len(s) == 1:`: If the string has only one character, it's a palindrome.\n    * `return 1`: Return 1.\n\n**3. Verification**\n\nLet's trace the algorithm with the example string \"bananas\":\n\n| i | s[i] | s[len(s) - 1 - i] | s[i] == s[len(s) - 1 - i] | longest_palindrome |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 0 | 'b' | 'a' | False | 0 |\n| 1 | 'a' | 'n' | True | 1 |\n| 2 | 'n' | 'a' | False | 1 |\n| 3 | 'a' | 'n' | False | 1 |\n| 4 | 'n' | 'a' | False | 1 |\n| 5 | 'a' | 's' | False | 1 |\n| 6 | 's' | 'a' | False | 1 |\n| 7 | 'a' | 's' | False | 1 |\n| 8 | 's' | 'n' | False | 1 |\n| 9 | 'n' | 'a' | False | 1 |\n| 10 | 'a' | 's' | False | 1 |\n| 11 | 's' | 'n' | False | 1 |\n| 12 | 'n' | 'a' | False | 1 |\n\nAfter the loop, `longest_palindrome = 1`.\n\nFinally, the function returns `1`.\n\n**4.  Output**\n\nThe algorithm returns `1`.\n\n**5.  Time and Space Complexity**\n\n* **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the string.  We iterate through the string once.\n* **Space Complexity:** O(1). We only use a few variables to store the `longest_palindrome` and `center_index`, so the space used doesn't depend on the input string's size.\n\n**Important Considerations & Potential Optimizations**\n\n* **More Complex Palindromes:**  This algorithm finds *any* palindrome.  If you need to find the *longest* palindrome, you could modify the algorithm to keep track of the longest palindrome found so far and return that.\n* **Preprocessing (Optional):**  For very long strings, you could pre-process the string by checking for palindromes of length 1. This would slightly improve performance in some cases.\n\nI hope this detailed explanation is helpful!  Let me know if you have any further questions.",
