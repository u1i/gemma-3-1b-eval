  "answer": "Okay, let\u2019s solve the quadratic equation 2x\u00b2 + 5x - 12 = 0 step-by-step.\n\n**1. Approach:**\n\nWe\u2019ll use the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is a general solution for any quadratic equation in the standard form ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0. The formula is:\n\nx = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nWe\u2019ll substitute the coefficients of the given equation into this formula.\n\n**2. Solution:**\n\n* **Step 1: Identify a, b, and c.**\n\nIn the equation 2x\u00b2 + 5x - 12 = 0, we have:\n* a = 2\n* b = 5\n* c = -12\n\n* **Step 2: Substitute the values into the quadratic formula.**\n\nx = (-5 \u00b1 \u221a(5\u00b2 - 4 * 2 * -12)) / (2 * 2)\nx = (-5 \u00b1 \u221a(25 + 96)) / 4\nx = (-5 \u00b1 \u221a121) / 4\nx = (-5 \u00b1 11) / 4\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions:\n\n* **Solution 1:** x = (-5 + 11) / 4 = 6 / 4 = 3/2 = 1.5\n* **Solution 2:** x = (-5 - 11) / 4 = -16 / 4 = -4\n\n* **Step 3: State the solutions.**\n\nTherefore, the solutions to the quadratic equation 2x\u00b2 + 5x - 12 = 0 are x = 3/2 and x = -4.\n\n**3. Verification:**\n\nLet's substitute each solution back into the original equation to verify:\n\n* **For x = 3/2:**\n   2(3/2)\u00b2 + 5(3/2) - 12 = 2(9/4) + 15/2 - 12 = 9/2 + 15/2 - 24/2 = (9 + 15 - 24) / 2 = 0/2 = 0. This confirms x = 3/2 is a solution.\n\n* **For x = -4:**\n   2(-4)\u00b2 + 5(-4) - 12 = 2(16) - 20 - 12 = 32 - 20 - 12 = 32 - 32 = 0. This confirms x = -4 is a solution.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth solutions, x = 3/2 and x = -4, satisfy the original equation.\n\n---\n\nDo you want me to:\n\n*   Explain any of these steps in more detail?\n*   Work through another example?",
