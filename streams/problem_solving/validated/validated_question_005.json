  "question": "A train travels at 60 mph for 2 hours then 75 mph for 1 hour. If it covered 165 miles total how long was it stopped?",
  "answer_1b": "Okay, let\u2019s solve this word problem step-by-step.\n\n**1. Approach:**\n\nThe problem presents a scenario where a train travels different distances in different time intervals. We need to determine how much time the train was stopped. We\u2019ll essentially work backward from the total distance traveled to find the time spent traveling.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n* **Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled in the first part of the journey.**\n   * The train travels at 60 mph for 2 hours.\n   * Distance = Speed x Time = 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles\n\n* **Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled in the second part of the journey.**\n   * The train travels at 75 mph for 1 hour.\n   * Distance = Speed x Time = 75 mph * 1 hour = 75 miles\n\n* **Step 3: Calculate the total distance traveled.**\n   * Total distance = 120 miles + 75 miles = 195 miles\n\n* **Step 4: Determine the total time spent traveling.**\n   * Total time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours\n\n* **Step 5: Calculate the time spent stopped.**\n   * The total distance is 165 miles.\n   * Total time = 3 hours.\n   * Time stopped = Total distance - Distance traveled = 165 miles - 195 miles = -30 miles.\n\nSince the result is negative, this means the train didn't travel the entire distance. We need to re-evaluate.\n\n* **Step 6: Re-evaluate the problem.** The problem states the train covered 165 miles *total*.  We need to figure out how much time it took to travel 165 miles.\n\n* **Step 7: Calculate the time for the first part of the journey.**\n   * Distance = Speed x Time = 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles\n\n* **Step 8: Calculate the time for the second part of the journey.**\n   * Distance = Speed x Time = 75 mph * 1 hour = 75 miles\n\n* **Step 9: Calculate the total time for both journeys.**\n   * Total time = 120 miles + 75 miles = 195 miles\n\n* **Step 10: Determine the time stopped.**\n   * Total distance = 165 miles.\n   * Total time = 195 miles.\n   * Time stopped = 165 miles - 195 miles = -30 miles.\n\nLet's try a different approach. The problem states the train covered 165 miles *total*. We need to find out how long it took to travel 165 miles.\n\n* **Step 11: Calculate the time for the first part of the journey.**\n   * Distance = Speed x Time = 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles\n\n* **Step 12: Calculate the time for the second part of the journey.**\n   * Distance = Speed x Time = 75 mph * 1 hour = 75 miles\n\n* **Step 13: Calculate the total time for both journeys.**\n   * Total time = 120 miles + 75 miles = 195 miles\n\n* **Step 14: Determine the time stopped.**\n   * Total distance = 165 miles.\n   * Total time = 195 miles.\n   * Time stopped = 165 miles - 195 miles = -30 miles.\n\nLet's re-examine the problem. The train traveled 165 miles. It traveled 60 mph for 2 hours, so it covered 120 miles. Then it traveled 75 mph for 1 hour, so it covered 75 miles. The total distance is 120 + 75 = 195 miles.\n\nThe problem states the train covered 165 miles *total*.  This means the total distance traveled is 165 miles.\n\n* **Step 15: Calculate the time spent traveling.**\n   * Time = Distance / Speed = 165 miles / 60 mph = 2.75 hours\n\n* **Step 16: Determine the time stopped.**\n   * Total time = 2.75 hours.\n   * Time stopped = 2.75 hours.\n\n**3. Verification:**\n\n*   Total distance traveled: 120 miles + 75 miles = 195 miles.\n*   Total time spent traveling: 2.75 hours.\n*   Total time = 195 miles / 60 mph = 3.25 hours.\n\nThe time stopped is 2.75 hours.\n\n**Answer:** It was stopped for 2.75 hours.",
  "answer_27b": "Here's how to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Calculate the distance traveled at 60 mph:** 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles\n2.  **Calculate the distance traveled at 75 mph:** 75 mph * 1 hour = 75 miles\n3.  **Calculate the total distance traveled while moving:** 120 miles + 75 miles = 195 miles\n4.  **Find the difference between the expected distance and the actual distance:** 195 miles - 165 miles = 30 miles\n5.  **Since the train traveled 30 miles less than the expected distance, the train must have been stopped for 30 miles worth of time which is 30/60 = 0.5 hr.**\n\nTherefore, the train was stopped for **0.5 hours** or 30 minutes.",

    "explanation": "The 1B model demonstrates a persistent struggle with correctly applying the given information and recognizing the inconsistency within the problem. It repeatedly cycles through calculations that lead to an incorrect conclusion. The initial approach is reasonable \u2013 to calculate distances for each leg of the journey. However, the model gets stuck on calculating a total distance of 195 miles and attempts to force-fit the given total distance of 165 miles into that framework. Though it recognizes the negative result (-30 miles) as an error, it doesn't fundamentally correct its understanding of the problem. The final attempt to calculate the time spent traveling using just the total distance and the first speed is an attempt to move forward but is based on a misinterpretation (assuming the entire distance was covered at that speed). It fails to acknowledge that the problem *implies* a contradiction.",
