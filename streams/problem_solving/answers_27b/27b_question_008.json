  "question": "A ball is thrown upward at 20 m/s. When will it reach 15m height? Show calculations.",
  "answer": "Okay, let's break down this physics problem.  Here's how to calculate when the ball reaches a height of 15 meters, along with the calculations:\n\n**Understanding the Concepts**\n\n*   **Initial Velocity (v\u2080):** 20 m/s (upward)\n*   **Acceleration (a):** -9.8 m/s\u00b2 (due to gravity, acting downwards. We use a negative sign to indicate it opposes the upward motion).\n*   **Displacement (\u0394y):** 15 m (the height we want to reach)\n*   **Time (t):**  This is what we need to find - the time it takes to reach 15 meters.\n\nWe'll use the following kinematic equation:\n\n\u0394y = v\u2080t + (1/2)at\u00b2\n\n**Solving the Problem**\n\n1.  **Plug in the values:**\n\n15 = 20t + (1/2)(-9.8)t\u00b2\n15 = 20t - 4.9t\u00b2\n\n2.  **Rearrange into a quadratic equation:**\n\n4.9t\u00b2 - 20t + 15 = 0\n\n3.  **Solve the quadratic equation.** We can use the quadratic formula:\n\n   t = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\n   Where:\n    *  a = 4.9\n    *  b = -20\n    *  c = 15\n\n   Plugging in these values:\n\n   t = (20 \u00b1 \u221a((-20)\u00b2 - 4 * 4.9 * 15)) / (2 * 4.9)\n   t = (20 \u00b1 \u221a(400 - 294)) / 9.8\n   t = (20 \u00b1 \u221a106) / 9.8\n   t = (20 \u00b1 10.2956) / 9.8\n\n4.  **Calculate the two possible times:**\n\n    *   **t\u2081 = (20 + 10.2956) / 9.8**\n        t\u2081 = 30.2956 / 9.8\n        t\u2081 \u2248 3.09 seconds\n\n    *   **t\u2082 = (20 - 10.2956) / 9.8**\n        t\u2082 = 9.7044 / 9.8\n        t\u2082 \u2248 0.99 seconds\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe ball will reach a height of 15 meters at two different times:\n\n*   **Approximately 0.99 seconds** (on the way up)\n*   **Approximately 3.09 seconds** (on the way down)\n\n**Explanation of the Two Times**\n\nThe ball reaches 15 meters twice because it passes that height on both its ascent (going up) and descent (coming down).  The earlier time (0.99 seconds) is when the ball is still moving upward, and the later time (3.09 seconds) is when the ball is moving downward.",
