  "question": "Eight people need to cross a bridge at night with one flashlight. The bridge holds max two people. Times to cross: (1",
  "answer": "Okay, here's the classic bridge and flashlight puzzle, along with the solution.  You've started to give the crossing times, so I'll assume you mean these times:\n\n*   Person 1: 1 minute\n*   Person 2: 2 minutes\n*   Person 3: 5 minutes\n*   Person 4: 8 minutes\n*   Person 5: 10 minutes\n*   Person 6: 15 minutes\n*   Person 7: 18 minutes\n*   Person 8: 20 minutes\n\n**The Strategy**\n\nThe key to solving this puzzle efficiently is to minimize the time lost by having the slower people bring the flashlight back.  The fastest two people always need to be involved in getting the others across. Generally, the two fastest people escort the two slowest across.\n\n**The Solution (and explanation)**\n\nHere's the optimal solution and the breakdown of each trip:\n\n1.  **1 and 2 cross:** (2 minutes) - The two fastest go over.\n2.  **1 returns with the flashlight:** (1 minute) - The fastest brings it back.\n3.  **5 and 8 cross:** (20 minutes) - The two slowest go over.\n4.  **2 returns with the flashlight:** (2 minutes) - The second fastest brings it back.\n5.  **1 and 3 cross:** (5 minutes) - The next two fastest go over.\n6.  **1 returns with the flashlight:** (1 minute) - The fastest brings it back.\n7.  **1 and 4 cross:** (8 minutes) - The next two fastest go over.\n8.  **1 returns with the flashlight:** (1 minute) - The fastest brings it back.\n9.  **1 and 6 cross:** (15 minutes) - The next two fastest go over.\n10. **1 returns with the flashlight:** (1 minute) - The fastest brings it back.\n11. **1 and 7 cross:** (18 minutes) - The next two fastest go over.\n\n**Total Time: 2 + 1 + 20 + 2 + 5 + 1 + 8 + 1 + 15 + 1 + 18 = 73 minutes**\n\n**Why this works**\n\nThe idea is to always have the fastest person come back with the flashlight. The two slowest people go together, which allows the fastest people to make efficient trips.\n\n**Important Note:**  This assumes that the time it takes to cross is essentially the time it takes for *both* people to get across (the slower person determines the total time for the pair).",
