  "question": "Investment of $10000 grows 8% annually. How long until it doubles? Show the math.",
  "answer": "Okay, here's how to calculate how long it takes for a $10,000 investment to double at an 8% annual growth rate, along with the math involved. We'll use the \"Rule of 72\" for a quick estimate and then the formal compound interest formula for a precise answer.\n\n**1. Rule of 72 (Quick Estimate)**\n\nThe Rule of 72 is a shortcut to estimate doubling time.  You divide 72 by the annual growth rate.\n\n*   Doubling Time \u2248 72 / Growth Rate\n*   Doubling Time \u2248 72 / 8\n*   Doubling Time \u2248 9 years\n\nThis means it will take roughly 9 years for the investment to double.  It's an approximation, but it's very close for rates around 6-10%.\n\n**2. Compound Interest Formula (Precise Calculation)**\n\nThe formula for compound interest is:\n\nA = P (1 + r)^n\n\nWhere:\n\n*   A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest ($20,000 in this case, since we want it to *double*)\n*   P = the principal investment amount (the initial amount of $10,000)\n*   r = the annual interest rate (as a decimal, so 8% becomes 0.08)\n*   n = the number of years (this is what we're trying to find)\n\nLet's plug in the values and solve for 'n':\n\n$20,000 = $10,000 (1 + 0.08)^n\n\n**Step 1: Divide both sides by $10,000**\n\n2 = (1.08)^n\n\n**Step 2: Use logarithms to solve for 'n'**\n\nTo isolate 'n', we need to use logarithms.  You can use the natural logarithm (ln) or the base-10 logarithm (log).  I'll use the natural logarithm:\n\nln(2) = ln((1.08)^n)\n\n**Step 3: Apply the logarithm power rule**\n\nThe power rule of logarithms states that ln(a^b) = b * ln(a). Applying this:\n\nln(2) = n * ln(1.08)\n\n**Step 4: Solve for 'n'**\n\nn = ln(2) / ln(1.08)\n\n**Step 5: Calculate**\n\nn \u2248 0.6931 / 0.07696\nn \u2248 9.006 years\n\n**Answer:**\n\nTherefore, it will take approximately **9.006 years** for the $10,000 investment to double at an 8% annual growth rate.  The Rule of 72 gave us a very close estimate.\n\n\n\nKey takeaways:\n\n* Compound interest is a powerful tool for investment growth.\n* The Rule of 72 provides a quick and easy way to estimate doubling time.\n* Logarithms are essential for precisely solving for the time period in compound interest calculations.",
