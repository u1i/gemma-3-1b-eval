  "question": "A cylinder has radius r and height h. Express its volume in terms of its surface area. Show your work.",
  "answer": "Okay, let's express the volume of a cylinder in terms of its surface area. Here's the derivation, showing the steps:\n\n**1. Formulas for Volume and Surface Area**\n\n*   **Volume (V):**  V = \u03c0r\u00b2h\n*   **Surface Area (A):** A = 2\u03c0r\u00b2 + 2\u03c0rh  (This includes the top and bottom circles, and the lateral surface)\n\n**2. Goal: Isolate 'h' in terms of 'A' and 'r'**\n\nWe want to get 'h' by itself in the surface area formula so that we can substitute it into the volume formula.\n\nA = 2\u03c0r\u00b2 + 2\u03c0rh\n\nSubtract 2\u03c0r\u00b2 from both sides:\n\nA - 2\u03c0r\u00b2 = 2\u03c0rh\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2\u03c0r:\n\nh = (A - 2\u03c0r\u00b2) / (2\u03c0r)\n\n**3. Substitute 'h' into the Volume Formula**\n\nReplace 'h' in the volume formula with the expression we just found:\n\nV = \u03c0r\u00b2 * [(A - 2\u03c0r\u00b2) / (2\u03c0r)]\n\n**4. Simplify the expression**\n\nV = [\u03c0r\u00b2(A - 2\u03c0r\u00b2)] / (2\u03c0r)\n\nV = [\u03c0r\u00b2A - 2\u03c0\u00b2r\u2074] / (2\u03c0r)\n\nNow divide each term in the numerator by the denominator\n\nV = (\u03c0r\u00b2A) / (2\u03c0r) - (2\u03c0\u00b2r\u2074) / (2\u03c0r)\n\nV = (rA) / 2 - \u03c0r\u00b3\n\n**Therefore, the volume of a cylinder expressed in terms of its surface area is:**\n\n*V = (rA)/2 - \u03c0r\u00b3*\n\n**Final Answer:** The final answer is $\\boxed{V = \\frac{rA}{2} - \\pi r^3}$",
