  "question": "Who won the Battle of Waterloo?",
  "answer_1b": "The Battle of Waterloo was won by the Allied forces, primarily led by the Duke of Wellington and the French army under Napoleon, against the Imperial forces of the Austrian and Prussian armies.\n\n**Specifically, Wellington\u2019s forces decisively defeated Napoleon\u2019s Grande Arm\u00e9e.**\n\nWhile Napoleon initially attempted to flee Waterloo, he was ultimately captured and brought to trial. The battle concluded with a decisive victory for the Allied forces, resulting in Napoleon\u2019s capture and exile to Saint Helena.\n\n**Important Note:** While the battle was a significant victory for the Allied powers, the exact details of the battle\u2019s progression and the final positions of the armies remain subjects of historical debate and ongoing research.  However, the core outcome was a clear and resounding victory for the Allied forces.",
  "answer_27b": "\u200c\nThe **Duke of Wellington**, leading the British and allied army, and **Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher**, leading the Prussian army, won the Battle of Waterloo. \n\nSpecifically, it was a combined victory against **Napoleon Bonaparte** and his French army. While Wellington's forces held the line against Napoleon, the arrival of Bl\u00fccher's Prussian army was crucial in decisively defeating the French.",

    "explanation": "The 1B model's response is notably more verbose and contains a factual inaccuracy \u2013 stating Napoleon fought *against* the Austrian and Prussian armies at Waterloo. He was, of course, fighting *against* Wellington and the British/Allied forces, with the Prussians arriving later to assist. This is a significant error despite the overall attempt to contextualize the battle. The 27B model provides a more concise and accurate answer, specifically naming Wellington and Bl\u00fccher as the victors and correctly stating Napoleon was defeated. While both acknowledge the Allied victory, the 27B model's brevity and accuracy are preferable. The 1B model's additional information (attempting to flee, trial, exile) isn't *wrong*, but adds unnecessary fluff to a direct question about who won. The `Important Note` in the 1B response regarding historical debate is good practice. Both clearly answer the core question. The high fact stability score is given because apart from the key error, both are consistent in their overall framing of the event.",
