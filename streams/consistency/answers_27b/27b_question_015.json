  "question": "What happens when you mix vinegar and baking soda?",
  "answer": "Okay, here's what happens when you mix vinegar and baking soda, explained as a chemical reaction:\n\n**The Short Answer:**\n\nYou get a fizzing, bubbling reaction that produces carbon dioxide gas, water, and sodium acetate.\n\n**The More Detailed Explanation (Chemical Reaction A level):**\n\n* **The Reactants:**\n    * **Vinegar:**  A dilute solution of *acetic acid* (CH\u2083COOH). This is the acid.\n    * **Baking Soda:**  *Sodium bicarbonate* (NaHCO\u2083). This is the base.\n\n* **The Chemical Equation:**\n\n   CH\u2083COOH(aq) + NaHCO\u2083(s)  \u2192  CO\u2082(g) + H\u2082O(l) + CH\u2083COONa(aq)\n\n   Let's break that down:\n    * **CH\u2083COOH(aq):** Acetic acid in aqueous solution (dissolved in water)\n    * **NaHCO\u2083(s):** Solid sodium bicarbonate\n    * **CO\u2082(g):** Carbon dioxide gas (the bubbles!)\n    * **H\u2082O(l):** Liquid water\n    * **CH\u2083COONa(aq):** Sodium acetate dissolved in water.  This is a salt.\n\n* **What's Happening:**\n\n1. **Acid-Base Reaction:** The acetic acid (acid) donates a proton (H\u207a) to the bicarbonate ion (HCO\u2083\u207b) from the baking soda (base).\n\n2. **Formation of Carbonic Acid:** This proton transfer initially forms *carbonic acid* (H\u2082CO\u2083). However, carbonic acid is unstable.\n\n3. **Decomposition of Carbonic Acid:**  Carbonic acid quickly decomposes into water (H\u2082O) and carbon dioxide gas (CO\u2082).\n\n4. **The Fizz:** The carbon dioxide gas is what you see as the fizzing and bubbling.  It's escaping from the liquid.\n\n5. **Sodium Acetate Remains:**  Sodium acetate remains dissolved in the water. You can't easily see it, but it's there.\n\n\n\n**In simpler terms:**  The acid and base neutralize each other, but one of the products is a gas. This gas creates the dramatic fizzing effect.\n\n\n\n**Safety Note:** While generally safe for household experiments, avoid getting the mixture in your eyes.  It's also not a good idea to do this in a completely sealed container, as the pressure from the carbon dioxide could cause it to explode.",
