  "question": "What scientific theories is Albert Einstein known for?",
  "answer": "Albert Einstein is renowned for developing several groundbreaking scientific theories that revolutionized our understanding of the universe. Here are the most prominent:\n\n* **Theory of Special Relativity (1905):** This theory fundamentally changed our understanding of space and time. Its key postulates are:\n    * The laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion (inertial frames).\n    * The speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of the motion of the light source.\n    *  Key consequences include: time dilation (time passes slower for moving objects), length contraction (moving objects appear shorter in the direction of motion), and the equivalence of mass and energy (expressed in the famous equation E=mc\u00b2).\n\n* **Theory of General Relativity (1915):**  This is arguably his most famous work, and it's a theory of gravity.  Instead of viewing gravity as a force, General Relativity describes it as a *curvature of spacetime* caused by mass and energy. This has many significant implications, including:\n    *  Bending of light around massive objects.\n    *  Gravitational time dilation (time passes slower in stronger gravitational fields).\n    *  The existence of black holes.\n    *  The expansion of the universe.\n    *  The basis for our understanding of cosmology.\n\n* **Photoelectric Effect (1905):**  While not a *theory* in the same way as relativity, Einstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect was crucial to the development of quantum mechanics. He proposed that light isn't just a wave, but also consists of discrete packets of energy called *photons*. This earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.\n\n* **Brownian Motion (1905):** Einstein provided a theoretical explanation for Brownian motion \u2013 the seemingly random movement of particles suspended in a fluid (liquid or gas).  His work provided strong evidence for the existence of atoms and molecules, which were still debated at the time.\n\n* **Mass-Energy Equivalence (E=mc\u00b2):** This is the most famous equation in physics, and a direct consequence of Special Relativity. It shows that mass and energy are interchangeable; a small amount of mass can be converted into a large amount of energy, and vice versa.  This principle underlies nuclear energy and nuclear weapons.\n\n**In summary, Einstein's work fundamentally reshaped our understanding of space, time, gravity, light, and the fundamental nature of matter and energy.** He is considered one of the most influential physicists of all time.",
