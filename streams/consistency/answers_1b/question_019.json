  "question": "What were Einstein's major contributions to physics?",
  "answer": "Okay, here\u2019s a clear, precise answer to your question about Einstein\u2019s major contributions to physics, based solely on verified facts:\n\n**Albert Einstein\u2019s major contributions to physics can be broadly categorized as follows:**\n\n*   **Theory of Relativity:** This is arguably his most significant contribution. He developed both Special and General Relativity, which revolutionized our understanding of space, time, gravity, and the universe.\n    *   **Special Relativity (1905):** This theory fundamentally altered our understanding of space and time, demonstrating that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion and that the speed of light in a vacuum is constant for all observers. It led to concepts like time dilation and length contraction.\n    *   **General Relativity (1915):** This theory describes gravity not as a force, but as a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. It provided a new framework for understanding the behavior of objects in strong gravitational fields, like those around black holes.\n\n*   **Mass-Energy Equivalence (E=mc\u00b2):** This famous equation demonstrated the equivalence of mass and energy, and it\u2019s the cornerstone of nuclear physics and the development of nuclear energy.  It essentially states that a small amount of mass can be converted into a tremendous amount of energy.\n\n*   **Quantum Theory Contributions (though not fully developed at the time):** While not a single, fully-fledged theory, Einstein made crucial contributions to the development of quantum theory, particularly through his work on the photoelectric effect and the explanation of the photoelectric effect.  He proposed that light is quantized into discrete packets of energy (photons).\n\n**Important Note:** While Einstein made groundbreaking theoretical advancements, he did not *discover* these concepts. He *developed* and *interpreted* them, building upon existing theories and formulating new ones.  His work was crucial in establishing the foundations of modern physics.\n\n**To reiterate, while Einstein made numerous important contributions, the *specifics* of his work are detailed in his published papers and books, and are not widely known outside of physics circles.**\n\n---\n\nDo you want me to elaborate on any of these points, perhaps provide a brief timeline of his work, or discuss a specific aspect in more detail?",
