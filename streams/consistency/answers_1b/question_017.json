  "question": "What is the capital of Australia?",
  "answer": "The capital of Australia is Canberra.\n\nWhile Canberra has been a planned city and a significant political and cultural center, it is officially designated as the capital.  There is no single, universally agreed-upon \u201ccapital\u201d for Australia, as it\u2019s a federal city. However, Canberra is the location of the Australian government and the seat of power.\n\nTherefore, while it\u2019s a significant and important location, it is *not* the official capital city of Australia.",
