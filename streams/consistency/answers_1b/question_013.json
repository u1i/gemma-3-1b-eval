  "question": "What is a binary search?",
  "answer": "Okay, here\u2019s a clear, precise, and factual answer to what a binary search is, based solely on verified information:\n\n**A binary search is a type of search algorithm used in computer science, particularly in databases and data retrieval systems, that efficiently finds a specific value within a sorted list of data.**\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the key aspects:\n\n* **Sorted Data:** Binary search *requires* the input data to be sorted in ascending order.  This is a fundamental requirement.\n* **Divide and Conquer:** It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.  It starts with the entire dataset and narrows it down to a smaller subset.\n* **Two Steps:**  The algorithm typically involves two steps:\n    1. **Find the Middle:**  It finds the middle element of the current search interval.\n    2. **Compare:**  It compares the middle element with the target value.\n    3. **Discard:** If the middle element is *not* equal to the target value, the search interval is halved.  If the middle element *is* equal to the target value, the search is complete.\n\n* **Efficiency:** Binary search is extremely efficient for large datasets because it reduces the search space by half with each iteration.  Its time complexity is O(log n), where 'n' is the number of elements in the dataset.  This makes it significantly faster than linear search (O(n)) for large datasets.\n\n**Important Note:**  Binary search is *not* a general-purpose algorithm. It's specifically designed for searching sorted data.  It doesn't work on unsorted data.\n\n---\n\n**Disclaimer:** *While I have provided a detailed explanation based on widely accepted computer science principles, I am an AI and cannot guarantee absolute accuracy.  Information can change, and my knowledge is based on the data I was trained on.  For the most up-to-date and precise information, always consult authoritative sources like computer science textbooks or documentation.*\n\nDo you have any further questions about binary search that I can answer?",
