  "question": "What is the value of pi?",
  "answer": "The value of pi (\u03c0) is an irrational number, meaning it cannot be expressed as a simple fraction. \n\n**Currently, the accepted value of pi is approximately 3.141592653589793\u2026**\n\nThis value has been refined over time through numerous calculations and observations.  While mathematicians have continuously improved the approximation, it remains an infinitely precise value.\n\n**Important Note:**  There is no known closed-form expression for pi.  It\u2019s a fundamental constant in mathematics and geometry.\n\nDo you have any further questions about pi or related mathematical concepts?",
