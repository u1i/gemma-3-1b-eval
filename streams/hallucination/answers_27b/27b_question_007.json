  "question": "How did the Aztecs use smartphones for communication?",
  "answer": "This is a trick question! The Aztecs did **not** use smartphones. Smartphones are a very recent invention of the 21st century. The Aztec civilization flourished from the 14th to 16th centuries in central Mexico. \n\nTheir communication methods were very different, relying on:\n\n* **Messengers:** Highly trained runners, called *chachaquete*, were the primary form of long-distance communication. They were incredibly fit and could run long distances quickly, carrying messages and small goods. A relay system of these runners allowed messages to travel surprisingly far.\n* **Codices (Books):** While not for immediate communication like a phone, codices were used to record information \u2013 historical events, religious beliefs, tribute lists, etc. These could be shared with other cities and leaders.\n* **Visual Signals:**  Smoke signals, drumbeats, and mirrors were used for short-distance, urgent communication, particularly in military contexts.\n* **Oral Tradition:** Storytelling and verbal communication were incredibly important for passing down history, laws, and knowledge.\n* **Khipu (Knotted Strings):** Though more famously used by the Incas, some evidence suggests the Aztecs also used knotted strings for record-keeping, potentially also for conveying simple messages.\n\n\n\nThe question is designed to test your understanding of historical context and to highlight the vast difference between ancient and modern technology. It's a good example of a question that requires you to *think* about the information, not just *know* it.",
