  "question": "Who invented the quantum teleporter in 1985?",
  "answer": "This is a bit of a trick question! The \"quantum teleporter\" wasn't *invented* in the sense of a physical device in 1985. It was **conceived as a theoretical possibility** in a scientific paper published in 1985. \n\nThe scientists who first described the concept of quantum teleportation were **Charles Bennett, Gilles Brassard, Claude Cr\u00e9peau, Richard Jozsa, Asher Peres, and William Wootters**.\n\nTheir paper, \"Quantum Teleportation,\" outlined the *protocol* for teleporting an unknown quantum state. It's important to understand it's *not* teleportation in the science fiction sense of moving matter. It's the transfer of information (the quantum state) from one location to another, using entanglement and classical communication.\n\nSo, the answer is a group: **Charles Bennett, Gilles Brassard, Claude Cr\u00e9peau, Richard Jozsa, Asher Peres, and William Wootters.**",
