      "Could benefit from a deeper discussion of the potential for 'rebound effects' - e.g., consumers purchasing other disposable items if they save money by not buying bags.",

      "The discussion on legal frameworks doesn\u2019t consider the current state of autonomous vehicle legislation, which is nascent and varies considerably.",
      "The connection between public perception and legal frameworks is underdeveloped - how do legal decisions influence or are influenced by public opinion?",
      "Neither model explicitly addresses the need for Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) standards in preclinical studies, although the mention of GMP implies some awareness of quality control.",
      "Both could be more specific regarding the variety of *in vitro* studies used to support *in vivo* findings.",
      "Doesn't fully explore the dynamic nature of these factors\u2014how they change over time and affect each other, leading to cascading failures.",
