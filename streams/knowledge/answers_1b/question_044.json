  "question": "How does the Black-Scholes model price options?",
  "answer": "Okay, here\u2019s a concise and factual explanation of how the Black-Scholes model prices options:\n\n**The Black-Scholes model uses a mathematical formula to determine the theoretical price of an option based on several key inputs.** Here\u2019s a breakdown:\n\n1. **Inputs:** The model relies on the following inputs:\n   * **Current Price of the Underlying Asset (e.g., Stock):** This is the asset the option is based on.\n   * **Strike Price:** The price at which the option holder can buy (call option) or sell (put option) the underlying asset.\n   * **Time to Expiration:** The remaining time until the option expires.\n   * **Risk-Free Interest Rate:** The rate of return on a risk-free investment (e.g., a government bond).\n   * **Volatility:**  A measure of how much the underlying asset's price fluctuates.  It's often estimated using historical volatility or implied volatility (derived from market prices).\n\n2. **Formula:** The core of the model is the Black-Scholes formula:\n\n   **C = S * N(d1) + K * e^(-rT) * N(d2)**\n\n   Where:\n    * **C** = Theoretical option price\n    * **S** = Current price of the underlying asset\n    * **N(x)** = Cumulative standard normal distribution function (the probability that a standard normal random variable will be less than or equal to x)\n    * **d1** =  A stochastic factor (a number derived from the current price, strike price, time to expiration, and volatility)\n    * **d2** =  Another stochastic factor (a number derived from the current price, strike price, time to expiration, and volatility)\n\n3. **Interpretation:** The formula calculates the theoretical option price based on these inputs.  The `N(d1)` and `N(d2)` terms represent the probability of the option being in the money (profitable) at expiration.\n\n**Important Note:** The Black-Scholes model is a *theoretical* model. It provides an estimate of the potential value of an option, but it doesn't account for all real-world factors that can affect option prices (like dividends, changes in volatility, or market sentiment).\n\n---\n\n**Disclaimer:** *I am an AI Chatbot and not a financial advisor.
