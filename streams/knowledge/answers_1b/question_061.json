  "question": "How does alternative splicing increase protein diversity?",
  "answer": "Okay, here\u2019s a concise and factual answer to how alternative splicing increases protein diversity:\n\n**Alternative splicing is a crucial mechanism that dramatically increases protein diversity by creating multiple protein isoforms from a single gene.**\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Gene Segmentation:**  A gene typically codes for a protein. However, within a gene, different combinations of exons (coding sequences) are selected to be included in the final protein.\n\n2. **Spliceosome:** This is a complex of proteins (the spliceosome) that reads and joins these exons in a specific order.\n\n3. **Multiple Isoforms:**  Different combinations of exons are spliced together, resulting in multiple different mRNA transcripts. Each mRNA transcript produces a unique protein isoform.\n\n4. **Functional Diversity:**  Because each isoform has a slightly different sequence, it can perform slightly different functions. This leads to a vast array of protein variants with varied roles within the cell.\n\n**In essence, alternative splicing acts like a genetic \u201cfactory\u201d that produces a multitude of protein versions from a single blueprint.**\n\n---\n\nDo you want me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this, such as:\n\n*   The role of spliceosome components?\n*   The impact of alternative splicing on disease?",
