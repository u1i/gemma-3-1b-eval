  "question": "How does virtue ethics differ from consequentialism?",
  "answer": "Okay, here\u2019s a concise and thorough explanation of the differences between virtue ethics and consequentialism regarding morality:\n\n**Virtue Ethics vs. Consequentialism: A Breakdown**\n\nBoth virtue ethics and consequentialism aim to guide moral decision-making, but they approach it from fundamentally different perspectives:\n\n* **Consequentialism:** This ethical theory argues that the morality of an action is determined solely by its *outcomes*.  The best action is the one that produces the best results \u2013 the greatest good for the greatest number.  It focuses on *what* will happen as a result of an action.  Key figures include Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill.  It\u2019s a *predictive* approach \u2013 you try to foresee the consequences of your actions.\n\n* **Virtue Ethics:** This ethical theory emphasizes *character* and the development of virtuous habits.  It asks: \u201cWhat kind of person should I be?\u201d  Instead of focusing on outcomes, it asks what virtues (e.g., honesty, courage, compassion) a person should cultivate.  The morality of an action is judged by whether it aligns with these virtues.  It\u2019s a *descriptive* approach \u2013 it\u2019s about *how* a person acts, not just *what* happens.\n\n**Here\u2019s a table summarizing the key differences:**\n\n| Feature           | Consequentialism           | Virtue Ethics              |\n|--------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| **Focus**          | Outcomes                    | Character & Virtues         |\n| **Decision-Making** | Based on consequences      | Based on moral principles   |\n| **Goal**            | Maximize good results       | Cultivate virtuous behavior |\n| **Approach**        | Predictive                   | Descriptive                  |\n\n\n**In short:** Consequentialism looks at the *what* of an action, while virtue ethics looks at the *who* \u2013 the person acting.\n\n\n---\n\n**Disclaimer:** *I am an AI and this information is for general knowledge and understanding only.
