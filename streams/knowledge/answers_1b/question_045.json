  "answer": "Okay, here\u2019s a concise and factual answer to the significance of the Coase Theorem:\n\n**The Coase Theorem, established by Joseph Coase in 1960, is a foundational principle in economics that states:**\n\n*   **In the absence of private property rights, and when transaction costs are low, parties can bargain to reach a solution that maximizes social welfare.**\n\n**Significance:**\n\n*   **Reduces Transaction Costs:** It fundamentally shifts the focus from the initial cost of establishing property rights to the cost of bargaining and negotiation.\n*   **Promotes Efficiency:** It encourages private solutions to societal problems because private parties are incentivized to find the best outcome through voluntary negotiation.\n*   **Foundation for Legal Reform:** It\u2019s a cornerstone of the legal reforms that significantly increased the use of the Coase Theorem in areas like land use, environmental regulations, and antitrust law.  It allows courts to resolve disputes without needing to establish formal property rights, simplifying legal processes.\n*   **Impact on Policy:** It has influenced policy decisions regarding resource allocation, environmental protection, and other areas where bargaining is crucial.\n\n**In short, the Coase Theorem provides a theoretical framework for resolving disputes and promoting efficiency through voluntary negotiation, a concept that has profoundly shaped economic law and practice.**\n\n---\n\nDo you want me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the Coase Theorem, such as its limitations or applications?",
