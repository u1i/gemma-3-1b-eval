  "question": "How does reader-response theory approach interpretation?",
  "answer": "Reader-response theory fundamentally argues that **interpretation is not a passive process of decoding meaning from a text, but a dynamic, subjective experience shaped by the reader\u2019s individual background, history, and emotional state.** It rejects the idea of a fixed, objective text and instead emphasizes the role of the reader in creating meaning.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of key aspects:\n\n* **Emphasis on the Reader:** The core of the theory is that meaning isn\u2019t inherent in the text itself, but emerges from the *reader\u2019s* interaction with it.\n* **Subjectivity:** Reader-response theory acknowledges that interpretation is inherently personal. Each reader brings their own experiences, beliefs, and perspectives to the text.\n* **Active Engagement:**  Readers are not simply decoding; they are actively engaging with the text, prompting questions, forming associations, and constructing their own meaning.\n* **Contextualization:**  The reader\u2019s background (cultural, personal, historical) heavily influences how they interpret a text.\n* **Multiple Interpretations:** Reader-response theory suggests there isn\u2019t a single \u201ccorrect\u201d interpretation; instead, there are multiple valid readings, each reflecting the unique perspective of the reader.\n\n\n**Key Figures & Influences:**\n\n* **Jacques Lacan:**  His work heavily influenced the theory, emphasizing the role of the unconscious in shaping interpretation.\n* **Paul Ricoeur:**  He explored the idea of \u201creading as a process of becoming\u201d and how the reader\u2019s journey shapes the meaning.\n\n\n**In essence, reader-response theory posits that meaning is a collaborative creation between the text and the reader.**\n\n---\n\n**Disclaimer:** This is a concise explanation. Reader-response theory is a complex and multifaceted framework with ongoing debate and variations within its various strands.",
