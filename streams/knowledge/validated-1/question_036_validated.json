      "issues": [
        "The answer primarily focuses on Eastern Woodlands tribes. While accurate for those cultures, it doesn't adequately represent the Raven's *much* more prominent role in Pacific Northwest Coast mythology (Haida, Tlingit, etc.) where it's a creator figure.",
        "The 'trickster' aspect is understated given its importance in many traditions."

      "score": 9,
      "analysis": "The answer presents a logical breakdown of the Raven's roles, moving from general characteristics to specific functions. The organization is clear and easy to follow, and the inclusion of a disclaimer about cultural variation demonstrates sound reasoning."
    },
    "completeness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The answer is incomplete because it heavily favors Eastern Woodlands perspectives and largely omits the significantly more elaborate and central role of Raven in Pacific Northwest Coast cultures. A complete answer would need to address both regions, or at least acknowledge the disparity in importance."
