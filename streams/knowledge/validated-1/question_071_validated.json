  "question": "How does Tarski's undefinability theorem relate to truth?",
  "answer": "Okay, here\u2019s a concise and factual explanation of Tarski\u2019s Undefinability Theorem and its relation to truth:\n\n**Tarski\u2019s Undefinability Theorem** states that *any attempt to define a term or property within a formal system (like logic) will inevitably lead to a contradiction*.  More formally, it\u2019s a foundational principle in logic that *no formal system can fully capture the truth of any statement*.\n\n**How it Relates to Truth:**\n\n* **Truth as a Contextual Property:** Tarski argues that truth isn\u2019t a property of the statement itself, but rather of the *context* in which it\u2019s used.  A statement is true if and only if it\u2019s true *within the specific framework* of the system where it\u2019s being applied.\n* **The System\u2019s Role:** The system\u2019s rules and definitions are crucial.  If the system is incomplete or ambiguous, it can\u2019t definitively determine the truth of any statement.\n* **Undefinability as a Tool:**  The theorem suggests that by *defining* terms within a system, we\u2019re essentially creating a *model* \u2013 a specific instance of the system\u2019s rules.  This model, however, is inherently limited and cannot fully capture the system\u2019s overall truth.  The system\u2019s definition *cannot* be a complete representation of the truth.\n\n**In essence, Tarski\u2019s theorem highlights the limitations of formal systems in capturing the full reality of truth.** It\u2019s a crucial concept for understanding the nature of formal logic and its relationship to the world.\n\n---\n\n**Do you want me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this, such as:**\n\n*   The historical context of the theorem?\n*   Its implications for different logical systems (e.g., modal logic)?",
